Each painting is created with acrylic on high-quality canvas and primed by hand for long-lasting color and clean texture. By default, the canvas ships rolled in a protective tube to keep international shipping safe and affordable. EU customers may request the painting stretched on a wooden frame for a ready-to-hang delivery. Every piece is painted individually, so subtle variations make each artwork one-of-a-kind. Custom sizes and progress photos are available upon request. Just you, the idea, and the canvas. Thank you for visiting and being part of this journey.</p><p>
